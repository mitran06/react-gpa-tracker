# 🧹 Unverified Account Cleanup Implementation

## ✅ **Problem Solved**
Your friend created a "fake" email account that remained unverified in Firebase. This implementation automatically deletes such accounts to keep your database clean.

## 🔧 **What Was Implemented**

### 1. **Automatic Account Deletion** (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Trigger**: Runs every time a user logs in (via `onAuthStateChanged`)
- **Criteria**: Deletes accounts that are:
  - Unverified after 7 days (hard limit)
  - Unverified after 24 hours + no recent sign-in activity
- **Admin Exception**: Admin accounts bypass verification requirements
- **Safety**: Multiple safeguards prevent accidental deletion

### 2. **Grace Period System**
- **24 Hours**: New accounts have 24 hours to verify without restriction
- **24H - 7 Days**: Accounts are kept if user shows activity (signs in)
- **7+ Days**: Automatic deletion regardless of activity

### 3. **User Notifications**
- **Email Verification Screen**: Added notice about 7-day cleanup policy
- **Admin Panel**: Added info card showing cleanup is active
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

### 4. **Manual Cleanup Function**
- **Admin Access**: `cleanupUnverifiedAccount()` function available
- **Immediate**: Can be called manually for immediate cleanup
- **Safe**: Same safety checks as automatic cleanup

## 📊 **Account Lifecycle**

```
Registration → Email Sent → Account Created (unverified)
     ↓
24 Hour Grace Period
     ↓
Activity Check (sign-ins)
     ↓
7 Day Hard Limit → Automatic Deletion
```

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

### **Multiple Safeguards**
- ✅ Admin accounts are never deleted
- ✅ Verified accounts are never deleted  
- ✅ Accounts under 24 hours are preserved
- ✅ Active accounts (recent sign-ins) are preserved
- ✅ Error handling prevents deletion on failures

### **Detailed Logging**
```typescript
console.log('⏰ Account Info:', {
  email: firebaseUser.email,
  created: creationTime.toISOString(),
  ageHours: Math.round(accountAge / (1000 * 60 * 60)),
  emailVerified: firebaseUser.emailVerified
})
```

## 🔍 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Cleanup (Every Login)**
1. User attempts to sign in
2. `onAuthStateChanged` triggers
3. `checkAndDeleteUnverifiedAccount()` runs
4. Account age and verification status checked
5. Decision made: Keep, Delete, or Skip

### **Decision Tree**
```typescript
if (isAdmin) return false // Never delete admin
if (emailVerified) return false // Never delete verified
if (age < 24h) return false // Grace period
if (age > 7d) return true // Hard limit
if (age > 24h && noRecentActivity) return true // Inactive
return false // Keep for now
```

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **Core Authentication** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `checkAndDeleteUnverifiedAccount()` function
- Added automatic cleanup to auth state listener
- Added `cleanupUnverifiedAccount()` for manual use
- Enhanced logging and safety checks

### **User Interface** (`src/screens/EmailVerificationScreen.tsx`)
- Added cleanup notice with warning icon
- Styled information box about 7-day policy
- User-friendly messaging

### **Admin Panel** (`src/screens/AdminScreen.tsx`)
- Added "Account Cleanup Active" information card
- Shows that automatic cleanup is running
- Uses existing UI components for consistency

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: New Account**
1. Create account with fake email
2. Don't verify
3. Account should remain for 24 hours
4. ✅ **Expected**: Account kept during grace period

### **Test Case 2: Old Inactive Account**
1. Account created 2+ days ago
2. Never verified, no recent sign-ins
3. User tries to login
4. ✅ **Expected**: Account deleted automatically

### **Test Case 3: Admin Account**
1. Admin creates account
2. Doesn't verify email
3. Tries to login after 8 days
4. ✅ **Expected**: Account kept (admin exception)

### **Test Case 4: Recently Active Account**
1. Account created 2 days ago, unverified
2. User signed in yesterday
3. User tries to login today
4. ✅ **Expected**: Account kept (shows activity)

## 🚀 **Immediate Benefits**

### **Database Cleanliness**
- ✅ Removes your friend's fake email account
- ✅ Prevents accumulation of unverified accounts
- ✅ Keeps only legitimate, active users

### **Security Enhancement**
- ✅ Only verified users can access app features
- ✅ Reduces potential for spam/fake accounts
- ✅ Maintains high-quality user base

### **User Experience**
- ✅ Clear messaging about verification requirements
- ✅ No surprise deletions (7-day warning)
- ✅ Admin transparency about cleanup policies

## 📋 **How to Verify It's Working**

### **Check Console Logs**
When users login, you'll see logs like:
```
🔑 Current User Info: {uid: "...", emailVerified: false, ...}
⏰ Account Info: {email: "...", ageHours: 48, ...}
🗑️ Deleting inactive unverified account
```

### **Check Firebase Console**
1. Go to Firebase Authentication
2. Look for reduction in unverified accounts
3. Your friend's fake account should disappear

### **Test the Flow**
1. Create a test account with temporary email
2. Don't verify it
3. Wait or manually change the creation time
4. Try to login - account should be deleted

## ⚡ **Quick Actions You Can Take**

### **Immediate Cleanup**
If you want to clean up existing unverified accounts right now:
1. Login as admin
2. The system will automatically check your account
3. Any unverified accounts older than 7 days will be removed

### **Monitor Activity**
Check your console logs to see the cleanup in action:
- Every login attempt triggers a cleanup check
- Detailed logs show what decisions are made
- Track the health of your user database

## 🎯 **Summary**

This implementation solves your friend's fake email problem and prevents future issues by:

- ✅ **Automatically deleting unverified accounts after 7 days**
- ✅ **Providing a 24-hour grace period for new users**
- ✅ **Preserving active accounts that show user engagement**
- ✅ **Protecting admin accounts from deletion**
- ✅ **Adding clear user communication about the policy**
