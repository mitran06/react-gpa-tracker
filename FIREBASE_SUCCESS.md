service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /templates/{templateId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth.uid == "YOUR_ADMIN_UID_HERE";
      allow delete: if request.auth.uid == "YOUR_ADMIN_UID_HERE";
    }
  }
}
```
